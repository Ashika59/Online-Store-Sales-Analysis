# Online-Store-Sales-Analysis
SQL mini project analysing online store sales to identify top customers, monthly revenue trends, and regional insights.

**Purposes of the Project**
The main goal of this project is to gain understanding from sales data, exploring the various factors that influence sales across different branches.

# Analysis List:

**Online Store Sales Analysis â€“ Business Questions
Customer Insights**

1.Who are the top 3 customers by total spend?

2.How many repeat customers does the store have?

3.What is the average spend per customer?

4.Which customers placed the most number of orders?

**Sales Performance**

1.What is the total revenue generated?

2.What is the average order value (AOV)?

3.How does sales trend month over month?

4.On which date did the store make the highest single-day revenue?

**Regional Insights**

1.Which region generates the highest revenue?

2.What percentage of total revenue comes from each region?

3.Do customers from certain regions place larger orders on average?

**Advanced Analysis (Optional for Extra Value)**

1.Use a window function to rank customers by spend within each region.

2.Calculate the revenue growth rate month-over-month.

3.Identify the top-selling quarter (Q1, Q2, etc.).

4.Find the customer lifetime value (CLV) = total spend per customer.
